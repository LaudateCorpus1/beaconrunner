    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- We improve upon our second [_Beacon Runner 2049_](../beaconrunner2049/br2049.html), an economics-focused simulation environment for eth2.\n",
    "- Validators are placed on an [asynchronous](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/) P2P network, with each validator storing their current view of the chain, incoming blocks and attestations in a `Store` object, as defined in the [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store).\n",
    "- Validator behaviours are fully modular and can be plugged into the simulation as long as they follow a simple API, to produce rich agent-based models. Try it yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand how validator behaviours map to rewards, penalties and chain outcomes. Ideally, validators who are rational are also honest, i.e., they run the eth2 protocol the way it \"should\" be run. But apart from how incentives are designed, there is no guarantee that this will indeed the case. And as we will see, honesty may not always have a unique instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we improve upon the [first](../beaconrunner/br.html) and [second](../beaconrunner2049/br2049.html) Beacon Runners by introducing a more full-fledged simulation environment. If you haven't read the previous two, that's OK! Let's catch up now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## _Previously, on..._\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [first notebook](../beaconrunner/br.html), we introduced the possibility of \"wrapping\" the current specs in a [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD) simulation environment. We defined simple _strategies_ for validators that allowed them to produce blocks and attest too. The implementation was centralised in the sense that all validators shared a common view of the chain at all times -- a situation akin to being on a network with _perfect information_ and _zero latency_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural next step was to relax this assumption, and allow different views of the chain to coexist. In the simplest case, these views have an empty intersection: this is the case when the network is perfectly _partitioned_, and each side of the partition works independently. [We explored in the second notebook](../beaconrunner2049/br2049.html) how the _inactivity leak_, which decreases the stake of inactive validators, eventually allows for finalisation to resume. But what if this intersection is not empty? In other words, what if some validators see both sides of the partition? More generally, what if each validator has their own view of the chain, governed by the messages they have received from other validators on the network?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the conditions we explore here. They are sufficient to represent a realistic p2p network, where validators receive updates from each other after some (random) delay. We'll reuse the network model introduced in the previous notebook, reintroduced in the next section with a brief introduction to the validator API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "[Once again](../beaconrunner2049/br2049.html), we import the specs loaded with a custom configuration file, `fast`, where epochs are only 4 slots long (for demonstration purposes)."

We've moved `honest_attest` and `honest_propose` to a new [validatorlib.py](https://github.com/ethereum/beaconrunner/tree/master/notebooks/beaconrunner2050/validatorlib.py) file. This file also defines a very important class, the `BRValidator`, intended to be an abstract superclass to custom validator implementations. `BRValidator` comes packaged with a `Store`, a nifty little helper class defined in the [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store) and a bunch more logic to record past actions and current parameters.

Subclasses of `BRValidator` must expose a `propose()` and an `attest()` method which return, respectively, a block or an attestation when queried (or `None` when they are shy and don't want to return anything yet). We provide an example implementation in [ASAPValidator.py](https://github.com/ethereum/beaconrunner/tree/master/notebooks/beaconrunner2050/ASAPValidator.py), a very nice validator who always proposes and attests as soon as they can, and honestly too."

Meanwhile, slots last for about 12 seconds and validators are only expected to attest a third of the way into the slot, i.e., 4 seconds in.

    "Now let's think about how to get the average balance. Of course, this depends on _which_ beacon chain state we are looking at. Each validator maintains their own current state, which is made up of all the blocks and attestations they have seen until now. All validators may not agree on the current balances of everyone! In the extreme case of a partition, which we discussed in the [previous notebook](../beaconrunner2049/br2049.html), the two sides of the partition had completely different accounts of the current distribution.\n",

If we believe our network is fully connected (i.e., no partition) with reasonable latency, it follows that all validators eventually receive any given message in a reasonable amount of time. Under these assumptions, to get a good idea of the distribution (of average balances) over all validators, it's probably enough to sample the distribution of any one validator."

    "So what have we done here?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a group of validators who are all individually keeping track of their view of the beacon state.\n",
    "- Validators are on a network and communicate with each other, keeping track of known (but perhaps unincluded) attestations and blocks.\n",
    "- Whenever something changes, e.g., the beginning of a new slot/epoch or a new block/attestation received on-the-wire (as in, from the p2p network), validators update their internals to parameterise their strategies.\n",
    "- Each step, the simulation pings all validators and asks whether they want to propose or attest at this point in time. Based on their current data and past actions, they either return a block and/or an attestation, or nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this nice playground for validators to roam around, we are getting close to a full-fledged _agent-based model_. But we need more agents! Who expects here that all validators will be ASAP always? And is ASAP the only \"good\" behaviour? Probably not!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the framework developed in this notebook to explore these questions, with a series of smaller \"case studies\" looking at specific questions. Note that our simulation environment is still incomplete: validators should do more than just proposing and attesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up until now we assumed proposers were taking on the responsibility of aggregating their known attestations to record them in their proposed blocks. In eth2, aggregators are functionally different, and are validators chosen randomly for each slot.\n",
    "- We also haven't given our validators the power to slash malicious validators. With a few tweaks here and there we can do that simply enough. "
