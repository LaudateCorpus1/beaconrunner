  <h2 id="How-to-use">How to use<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-to-use">&#182;</a></h2><p>In this noteboook we test the rewards given out by the protocol to different types of validators. Our <code>fast</code> config reduces the size of most constants to avoid allocating more memory than necessary (we'll only test with a few validators). We also reduce the number of slots per epoch to speed things up. All these changes are without loss of generality.</p>
<p>You may test various spec versions by renaming either of the <code>specs_*.py</code> files in the <code>beaconrunner</code> folder to <code>specs.py</code>. Current version tested is v1.1.0-alpha.7.</p>

  <h2 id="Obtaining-rewards-per-duty">Obtaining rewards per duty<a class="anchor-link" href="#Obtaining-rewards-per-duty">&#182;</a></h2><p>We isolate validators who occupied a unique role over a slot to obtain the rewards for block proposers and sync committee members. When rewards are given out during the epoch transition, the minimum received by any validator is received by a validator who neither proposed a block for the whole epoch and was never part of the sync committee, giving us the attester reward received by one validator.</p>
